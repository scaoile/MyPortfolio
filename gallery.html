                            I Graduated Senior High at Baliuag University in the municipality of Bulacan. I took the STEM strand as it is the most flexible out of all for me. 
                            <br><br>
                            My hobbies are playing casual games, reading manga, watching anime, listening to music, playing with our cats, and talking with my favorite person. 
                            <br><br>
                            I am half-Chinese and half-Filipino, whereas my Father is the Chinese.
                            <br><br>
                            I strive to work hard to achieve a comfortable future.

                                This cat’s name is Shine, I have no idea where the name came from but Shine came from my Grandparents Superette. She was just a few months old at that time.
                                <br><br>
                                Now, she has 4 children in total. I can consider her as one of the most elegant-looking cats we’ve ever had.
                                <br><br>
                                We’ve had around 10+ cats before Shine but that is before we move out at Quezon City. We didn’t abandon them but they all left before we even moved.

                                For the first generation of Shine’s children. We named the two as Sky and Star.
                                <br><br>
                                Sky is a very affectionate cat that loves human contact. Meanwhile, Star is somewhat nervous around humans but she’s affectionate too at times you won’t expect.
                                <br><br>
                                Star often sleeps beside me while Sky likes to rub his body on me at random times.
                                <br><br>
                                They’re both lovely cats and very energetic at times.

                                <br><br>
                                Night is naughtier than Polka. For instance, when you’re eating there will be no time that you will be undisturbed when Night is around.
                                <br><br>
                                On the other hand, Polka is also naught but not as much as Night.
                                <br><br>
                                Unlike Sky and Star, Night and Polka are not affectionate.

                                He’s a very affectionate kitten and energetic. Even though he’s the only one from this generation he adapted and played with his older siblings instead.

                                His eyes are what makes him adorable. His energeticness is also very cute.

                                    She always makes my day even though I’m tired. I can’t even express how thankful I am that she exists. As I don’t even know what I would be without her.
